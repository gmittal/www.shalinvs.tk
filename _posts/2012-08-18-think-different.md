I was on youtube the other day, and I encountered this video. I have to admit, this is one the most inspiring videos I have seen, despite that it's only 1 minute long.

Steve Jobs narrates the first Think Different commercial "Here's to the Crazy Ones". It never aired.

Also, this is my favorite Steve Jobs quote:
<blockquote>"When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: 'If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right.' It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: 'If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?' And whenever the answer has been 'No' for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.

Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart."</blockquote>

Steve Jobs has changed our lives not just with Apple, but he has also inspired us all with his passion and determination to change the world.

You inspired yet?
