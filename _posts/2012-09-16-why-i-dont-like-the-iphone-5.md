So Apple just announced the iPhone 5 on Wednesday (September 12, 2012) and I don't think it's worthy of being Apple's "think different" product... There was no "WOW" moment after finally seeing it released... Don't believe me? Let me elaborate the "features"...

## Faster.
Every new iPhone they release claims that everything loads 2 times faster, but is that true?
And even in the Apple Retail Stores, the phones seem fast because they only have 1 GB of content on it, but as soon as you download games and store photos on it, your phone gets bulky...
And besides, no one will even notice the speed difference...
It's not like your going to time the speed of it...

## Thin and light.
Great! Now I have to be even more careful not to drop my iPhone because lighter means more frail. 
I also have to make sure my thin iPhone doesn't slip out of my loose pants when I'm eating at a restaurant or at the theater.

## Taller.
I can really live without Apple adding the extra 80 pixels of screen to my iPhone... It makes the phone too big and it loses its elegance. Besides, getting one more row of apps isn't a feature. In fact, I think its annoying since it makes it harder to get used to the layout on the screen.

## Improved battery life.
I've heard this same thing on every single iPhone release, and yet they seem to get the same amount of battery life.
It only takes a few hours to completely empty the battery of an iPhone 4s or any other models.
You have to optimize the phone to make it last longer!

## New power cord.
Okay, so now, I can't use anyone else's battery chord for my iPhone.
When I'm usually at my friend's house, I can just ask to borrow his charger when I'm low on battery.
Thanks to Apple, I have lost that capability. (Unless he gets an iPhone 5)

## Better camera.
WOW, I totally didn't see this feature coming!
But seriously, is that such a big impact on everyone?
I can live without a better camera in my phone, plus there are like hundred's of apps that edit photos really nicely (my favorite would be camera plus)
I wouldn't buy another $300 device just for this feature...

## The Headphone jack on the bottom.
This is just plain <b>DUMB</b>.
Why would they move the headphone jack to the bottom of the phone?
I carry my phone in my pocket (most people do) and now Iâ€™ve got to drop my iPhone in my pocket upside down to avoid damaging the connection.

## This means...
This means the iPhone is losing their "WOW" feeling with every product they release, and pretty soon, their phones will be just like any other phone. 

The iPhone doesn't <b>SUCK</b>, I never said that, but it isn't different, either. I love apple, but I hope they make their iPhones better :)
