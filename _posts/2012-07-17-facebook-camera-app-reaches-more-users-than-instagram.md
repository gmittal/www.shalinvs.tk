Hopefully, we have all heard of Instagram. Well, after Facebook bought Instagram for 1 Billion $$, Facebook released their own little iOS Camera app and added extra cozy little features.

The new Facebook camera app will allow users to share single photos or sets of photos, with an added scroll through function for those viewing the photos. Just what does all of that mean? If it wasn't already easy enough to post pictures to Facebook, now it will be even easier and quicker. Facebook Camera lets you rapidly pick one or more photos, apply filters, tag friends and locations, add a description, and post.

For those who aren't crazy about loading pictures on a Facebook that you may share with co-workers and even bosses, it is important to note the instant tag function on the new app. Now may be a great time to alter tagging settings, if you haven't already.

Of course, Instagram is has already been around for a while, so how is this app going to be any better? The best feature of Facebook Camera and its one real selling point over Instagram is multi-photo uploads. This helps you tell a story or share the best photos from a day's outing in a single post. It's great for if you can't decide which shot is best and don't want to go through the sharing flow over and over.

Another neat new feature is that rather than having to wait for a photo to load when you browse by like on Instagram, it appears as a blurry placeholder at first and then sharpens up, which is nice. Facebook Camera's 14 filters are also more sensibly named with titles that describe how they change photos, such as Bright, Emerald, and Copper, rather than Instagram's less indicative Hudson, Sutro, and Brannan. Filters, cropping, and batch uploads could appear in the main Facebook app soon.

While Facebook may be late to the standalone photo app scene, you have to remember that while Instagram has hit <strong>50 million downloads</strong>, Facebook has over <strong>500 million mobile users, and somewhere around 220 million on iOS and Android</strong>. As the social network's user base shifts to mobile, the app will be crucial to keeping people engaged.

### Update:
<em>New!</em> Facebook Camera App Gets Renamed:

If you updated your Facebook Camera app in the past day, you might have noticed that it now has a different name on your IOS device's home screen.

When the social network released the standalone camera app late last month, it appeared on your home screen simply as "Camera". The Problem was that's the same name as Apple's own built-in camera app. To remediate this issue, Facebook on Monday released an update that gives the app a slightly strange new screen name - "Camera<b>&#183;</b>" to avoid any possible user confusion.

Also, the latest version of the app, 1.0.2, also comes with a number of improvements, such as more reliable uploads and a better explanation about location services access. Facebook says the app now works better when location services are turned off. The update also rolled out fixes for bugs that caused posts to create multiple timeline stories and show photos out-of-order.

So that is the new Facebook camera app although, I still prefer the main Facebook app (I don't post many photos). But I would suggest Facebook's Camera app because it synchronizes content (photos) from Instagram, and Path.
