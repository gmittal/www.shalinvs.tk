Welcome to www.shalinvs.tk (soon to be www.shalin.me), the blog of Shalin Shah. I'm just a 8th Grade (13 year old) student, web developer, and hacker. Please enjoy this blog. I will be posting cool articles, hacks, tips and tricks, and some stuff about the web (and programming).

:)

I started this blog to improve my writing and I want to get more known in the industry (and get to know other people).
I will post some stuff soon...
