<!-- Here are <strong>my favorite quotes</strong> from programmers, athletes, and revolutionary figures that inspire me or make me laugh. I hope you enjoy them!

<h2>Computers</h2>
<blockquote>The only legitimate use of a computer is to play games.
-- Eugene Jarvis</blockquote>
<blockquote>I may have invented Control-Alt-Delete, but Bill Gates made it famous.
-- David Bradley, designer of the IBM PC</blockquote>
<h2>Design</h2>


<blockquote>When you don't create things, you become defined by your tastes rather than your ability. Your tastes only narrow & exclude people. So create.
-- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff">_why</a></blockquote>


<h2>Education</h2>
<blockquote>Data is not information. Information is not knowledge. Knowledge is not understanding. Understanding is not wisdom.
-- Clifford Stoll</blockquote>
<blockquote>Probably the biggest lie told in schools ... is that the way to succeed is through following "the rules." In fact most such rules are just hacks to manage large groups efficiently.
-- <a href="http://paulgraham.com/lies.html">Paul Graham</a></blockquote>
<blockquote>Public schools don’t fail to educate students. They succeed at dumbing them down. The true purpose of compulsory education is to make people childish, docile, conformist, obedient, and predictable – and to squash qualities like dissent, originality, leadership, and independence.
-- <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig11/finnigan-t1.1.1.html">Tom Finnigan</a></blockquote>

<h2>Freedom</h2>
<blockquote>If you are not free to choose wrongly and irresponsibly, you are not free at all.
-- Jacob Hornberger</blockquote>
<blockquote>Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.
-- Benjamin Franklin</blockquote>
<blockquote>He that would make his own liberty secure, must guard even his enemy from opposition; for if he violates this duty he establishes a precedent that will reach himself.
-- Thomas Paine</blockquote>
<blockquote>Here is my advice as we begin the century that will lead to 2081.  First, guard the freedom of ideas at all costs.  Be alert that dictators have always played on the natural human tendency to blame others and to oversimplify.  And don't regard yourself as a guardian of freedom unless you respect and preserve the rights of people you disagree with to free, public, unhampered expression.
-- Gerard K. O'Neill</blockquote>
<blockquote>The people never give up their liberties but under some delusion.
-- Edmund Burke</blockquote>
<blockquote>I prefer liberty with danger to peace with slavery.
-- Jean-Jacques Rousseau</blockquote>
<blockquote>Terrorism is about magnifying one mediagenic act of violence into one hundred billion acts of terrorized authoritarian idiocy.
-- <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2009/11/30/bbc-photographer-pre.html">Cory Doctorow</a></blockquote>
<blockquote>None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free.
-- Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</blockquote>
<blockquote>The spirit of resistance to government, is so valuable on certain occasions, that I wish it always to be kept alive.
-- Thomas Jefferson</blockquote>
<h2>Free Software</h2>
<blockquote>Odious ideas are not entitled to hide from criticism behind the human shield of their believers' feelings.
-- Richard Stallman</blockquote>
<blockquote>On the one hand, information wants to be expensive, because it’s so valuable. On the other hand, information wants to be free, because the cost of getting it out is getting lower and lower all the time. So you have these two fighting against each other.
-- Stewart Brand</blockquote>

<h2>Programming</h2>
<blockquote>Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. So if you're as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it?
-- Brian Kernighan</blockquote>
<blockquote>More computing sins are committed in the name of efficiency (without necessarily achieving it) than for any other single reason -- including blind stupidity.
-- W.A. Wulf</blockquote>
<blockquote>[To a class of <a href="http://cs106b.stanford.edu">Stanford CS106B</a> students] You should try opening up the C++ STL header files some time -- it will be a very eye-opening experience, sort of how looking directly at the Sun is a eye-opening --err, eye-closing experience.
-- <a href="http://www.keithschwarz.com/">Keith Schwarz</a></blockquote>
<h2>Programming - Bug Stories</h2>
<blockquote>There was a computer that we shipped where the speaker’s magnet was right next to the hard drive. Now, when you played a sound, it caused the hard drive’s read/write head to misalign. So in the midst of playing your Quicktime movie, your computer would completely freeze because it played a sound. And I was like, “what kind of engineers do we have around here that would put a magnet right next to your computer’s hard drive?”

"Jesus Christ… it’s just… it beeped, and it crashed."

And then they wanted me — believe it or not, this is the solution — they wanted me to change the decibels of the speaker so that it wouldn’t interfere with the hard drive. I mean, you’re kidding me. That’s… Classic.

Engineers are retarded. They have some kind of brain damage that allows them to not have social skills so they can concentrate long enough to write code. But it’s a disease.

That’s why I had to quit. I’m like an engineer in recovery. I don’t want to write code anymore. It just makes you retarded.

Get a girlfriend. Get a life.
-- Jim Reekes from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1247703/">Welcome to Macintosh</a></blockquote>
<blockquote>[About the Motorola Droid camera auto-focus feature] "There's a rounding-error bug in the camera driver's autofocus routine (which uses a timestamp) that causes autofocus to behave poorly on a 24.5-day cycle. That is, it'll work for 24.5 days, then have poor performance for 24.5 days, then work again.

The 17th is the start of a new "works correctly" cycle, so the devices will be fine for a while. A permanent fix is in the works.
-- Google engineer, Dan Morrill</blockquote>
<h2>Sports</h2>
<blockquote>What I want is to be number one.
-- Steve Prefontaine</blockquote>
<blockquote>Somebody may beat me, but they are going to have to bleed to do it.
-- Steve Prefontaine</blockquote>
<blockquote>I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.
-- Michael Jordan</blockquote>
<blockquote>At home I am a nice guy: but I don't want the world to know. Humble people, I've found, don't get very far.
-- Muhammad Ali</blockquote>
<blockquote>The will to succeed is important, but what's more important is the will to prepare.
-- Bobby Knight</blockquote>
<h2>Startups</h2>
<blockquote>Big companies want to decrease the standard deviation of design outcomes because they want to avoid disasters. But when you damp oscillations, you lose the high points as well as the low. This is not a problem for big companies, because they don't win by making great products. Big companies win by sucking less than other big companies.
-- <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html">Paul Graham</a></blockquote>
<blockquote>Far better is it to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs, even though checkered by failure... than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy nor suffer much, because they live in a gray twilight that knows not victory nor defeat.
-- Theodore Roosevelt</blockquote>
<blockquote>The master of the art of living makes little distinction between his work and his play, his labor and his leisure, his mind and his body, his education and his recreation, his love and his religion. He simply pursues his vision of excellence in whatever he does, leaving others to decide whether he is working or playing. To him, he is always doing both.
-- Buddha</blockquote>
<h2>Time</h2>
<blockquote>We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today. We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now. In this unfolding conundrum of life and history there is such a thing as being too late. Procrastination is still the thief of time. Life often leaves us standing bare, naked and dejected with a lost opportunity. The "tide in the affairs of men" does not remain at the flood; it ebbs. We may cry out deperately for time to pause in her passage, but time is deaf to every plea and rushes on. Over the bleached bones and jumbled residue of numerous civilizations are written the pathetic words: "Too late."
-- Martin Luther King, Jr.</blockquote>
<blockquote>It’s not enough to be busy, so are the ants. The question is, what are we busy about?
-- Henry David Thoreau</blockquote>

-- Peter Ustinov</blockquote>
<blockquote>If you want to make peace, you don't talk to your friends. You talk to your enemies.
-- Moshe Dayan</blockquote>
<blockquote>Everyone's a pacifist between wars. It's like being a vegetarian between meals.
-- Colman McCarthy</blockquote>
<blockquote>When goods don’t cross borders, armies will.
-- Frederic Bastiat</blockquote>
<blockquote>Non-violence leads to the highest ethics, which is the goal of all evolution. Until we stop harming all other living beings, we are still savages.
-- Thomas Edison</blockquote>
<blockquote>Imagine all the people living life in peace. You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one. I hope someday you'll join us, and the world will live as one.
-- John Lennon</blockquote>

<blockquote>Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. This is not a way of life at all in any true sense. Under the clouds of war, it is humanity hanging on a cross of iron.
-- Dwight D. Eisenhower</blockquote> -->
