  <h2>Research</h2>

  <h3>
    <a href="https://github.com/feross/WireSheep">WireSheep</a> &mdash; Original Tool
    <span>Nov 2011</span>
    <span><a href="https://github.com/feross/WireSheep">code</a></span>
  </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>News Feed of activity on your local network</li>
    <li>WireSheep lets you sniff packets on an open WiFi network. Instead of just stealing login cookies, like FireSheep, it lets you see traffic in realtime, like Wireshark. WireSheep shows you each user on the network and all the HTTP requests they’re making.</li>
    <li>Built with teammates John Heisey, Nikil Viswanathan, and Daniel Posch.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>
    <a href="/cmsploit/">CMSploit</a> &mdash; Original Research
    <span>Nov 2011</span>
    <span><a href="https://github.com/feross/CMSploit">code</a></span>
  </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Nearly 1% of websites built with a content management system (like WordPress or Joomla) are unknowingly exposing their database password to anyone who knows where to look.</li>
    <li>Temp files created by text editors may still linger after editing is finished, exposing the configuration file and database credentials to attackers.</li>
    <li>I wrote an automatic program to test for the prevalence of this issue across the wider web. I tested the top 200,000 websites and found that 0.77% of websites running a CMS have publicly-visible config files and database passwords.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>
    <a href="/webcam-spy/">Adobe Flash Remote Webcam Exploit</a> &mdash; Original Research
    <span>Oct 2011</span>
    <span><a href="https://github.com/feross/webcam-spy">code</a></span>
  </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I discovered a vulnerability in Adobe Flash that allows any website to turn on your webcam and microphone without your knowledge or consent to spy on you.</li>
    <li>It uses user interface redressing (clickjacking) to trick the user into doing a series of four clicks which remotely enables their webcam.</li>
    <li>The exploit was covered on CNET, Wired.com, The Register, Ars Technica, Gizmodo, PC World, Yahoo! News, ZDNet, The Inquirer, and Computer World.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>
    <a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/publications/2009/retargeting/retargeting-CHI09-WIP.pdf">Automatic Retargeting of Webpage Content</a> &mdash; Stanford Computer Science &mdash; Human-Computer Interaction Lab
    <span>Summer 2009</span>
  </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>We built an application for casual web designers to explore possible designs for their website.</li>
    <li>The designer selects a site they like and they can apply it's page layout and styles to their own site.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Organizations</h2>

    <li>Items were donated by Stanford students, faculty, and local businesses, and auctioned off with all proceeds donated to the Stanford Opportunity Center.</li>
